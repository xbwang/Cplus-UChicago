problem1: problem1.cpp, compiled.
problem2: problem2.cpp, compiled with Typelist.h.
problem3: problem3.cpp, compiled with Typelist.h. I write the codes in the problem3.cpp in order to be graded clear. Also I put the codes(commented) in the Typelist.h so that Typelist.cpp could be compiled with Typelist.h if you uncomment them.
problem4: problem4.cpp, compiled with Typelist.h.
problem5: problem5.cpp, compiled with Typelist.h.
